# orbits
Repository for orbit programs and stuff.

So I can stop wondering about tracking changes and allow for up to date version.

## Python
- orbits.py: Creates orbit class and space class for methods dealing with orbit instances. See documentation at the beginning of the file.

## Matlab
- orbit.m
- space.m

(orbit.m depends on space.m)

- orbits_demo.m: Example use of orbit.m and space.m.

Based off orbits.py, but with less features.

## Jupyter Notebooks
- Orbit notebook.ipynb: Used for development and debugging of orbits.py (backup file).
- Orbit calculations notebook.ipynb: Calculations for formulas implemented in orbits.py.
- Planet orbital elements.ipynb: Downloads data about planets and plans an interplanetary transfer.
- Anomalie moyenne - vraie.ipynb: Calculates the transformation from mean anomaly to true anomaly and formats it to be inputted in a LaTeX document.
